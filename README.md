## Aim:

To design a combined UX scenario that integrates learning and playing into a single, engaging interface — promoting fun-based learning, motivation, and cognitive skill development for students.

## Algorithm:
##### Identify User Needs:
Understand users’ goals related to education, entertainment, and skill improvement.

##### Design Unified UI:
Create a seamless platform where users can learn through interactive games, quizzes, and challenges.

##### Integrate Core Features:
Include progress tracking, leaderboard competitions, rewards, and personalized learning paths.

##### Test & Refine:
Conduct usability testing to enhance clarity, engagement, and ease of navigation.

##### Deploy & Monitor:
Launch the prototype, collect feedback from students and parents, and improve based on engagement analytics.

### 1. Solution Ideation

Method Used: Brainwriting Ideation Exercise
Theme: “EduPlay” – A smart app combining education and entertainment.

###### Eight Creative Ideas Generated:

1.Personalized dashboard showing subjects, progress, and badges.

2.“Learn Through Games” – educational mini-games for each subject.

3.AI tutor that suggests games or quizzes based on weak areas.

4.Daily learning streaks with reward points and certificates.

5.Multiplayer quiz battles to make studying social and fun.

6.Voice-enabled hints and explanations during gameplay.

7.Parent dashboard to monitor child’s learning progress.

8.Augmented Reality (AR) challenges for visual learning (e.g., math in 3D).

### 2. Creating User Stories

Using personas such as school student, teacher, parent, slow learner, and topper, the following stories were created:

| # | User Story                                                                                |
| - | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | As a student, I want to learn through games so that I can study in a fun way.             |
| 2 | As a teacher, I want to assign quiz challenges so that students stay engaged.             |
| 3 | As a parent, I want to view my child’s progress so that I can track their improvement.    |
| 4 | As a slow learner, I want personalized suggestions so that I can focus on my weak topics. |
| 5 | As a topper, I want leaderboards so that I can compete and stay motivated.                |

### 3. Creating Scenarios

#### Chosen User Story:

As a student, I want to learn through games so that I can study in a fun way.

Scenario Narrative:
Riya, a 14-year-old student, opens the “EduPlay” app after school. She sees her progress bar for Science and Math. The app suggests a “Space Explorer” game to help her learn planets. Riya plays the quiz game, earns 50 points, and unlocks a badge. She feels excited as she climbs up the leaderboard among her classmates.

Emotional State: Curious → Focused → Excited → Motivated

Environment: Home study desk with her tablet.

Tasks:
Open app → View progress → Play learning game → Earn rewards → View leaderboard

### 5. Information Architecture (IA)

Example Application: EduPlay App
Method Used: Closed Card Sorting

| Category  | Features                               |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Dashboard | Overall Progress, Streak, Badges       |
| Learn     | Subjects, Lessons, Interactive Quizzes |
| Play      | Games, Challenges, Multiplayer Battles |
| Progress  | Reports, Leaderboard, Rewards          |
| Settings  | Profile, Notifications, Help, Logout   |

#### Resulting Sitemap Structure:
```
